## Part 1


## Part 2
While there are several useful and cool things I learned throughout the second half of this course, something that I found particularly interesting was during lab 7 when we learned about vim. Playing around on vimtutor was quite fun and I was able to learn a lot about
the different and most common vim commands. Because I had previously never used vim before, this online tutorial allowed me to gain my first exposure to vim and I was able to run several commands that I could see being useful and applicable in the real world. The hands
on practice was something that I really appreciated and it helped me better understand the purpose and output of each command.
