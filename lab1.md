# Step 1 - Installing VScode
To install VScode, you go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the download instructions. Once it installs, you can open up the program and you'll see this image below:

# Step 2 - Remotely Connecting
To begin the remote connection process, go to VScode and open up a terminal through there. You will then type the following command, replacing `zz` with the letters in your specific account:
```
$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Once you have done so, your screen should look something like this (if there is a message that asks if you would like to continue connecting, say yes):

Now, you have successfully connected to the remote server and any conmmand that you run will also run on a computer in the CSE basement!

# Step 3 - Trying Some Commands
There are various commands that you can run through the terminal, such as `cd`, `ls`,` ls -lat`, `pwd`, among many others. Here is an example of what running these commands would look like:
